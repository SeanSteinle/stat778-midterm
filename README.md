# STAT778 Midterm
*Sean Steinle*

This is my submission for the STAT778 midterm at GMU.

## Instructions

To run my code, please run `python main.py`. In `main.py` there is a function for each section of the homework (except 1a which is solved by `rmvexp()` in `rng.py`). All other Python files container helper functions. Intermediate outputs are saved in `data/` and visualizations in `plots`.
